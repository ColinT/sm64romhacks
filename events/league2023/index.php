				The ongoing league features 3 hacks and multiple categories. The league starts immediately after the draft held on 16 September 2023 and runs through October 31st. The current individual user leaderboard can be found <a href="#leaderboard">here</a><br/><br/>
				<h2 id="what">WHAT IS A LEAGUE?</h2>
				League is community event open to any speedrunners. Participants are drafted onto teams and can earn points for their team by getting PBs in the selected categories and submitting them to speedrun.com.<br/><br/>
				<h3 id="teams">HOW ARE TEAMS DETERMINED?</h3>
				The teams are determined by a draft. Players that opt to be a captain are the ones that draft their teams. Anyone can signup to be a potential captain but the number of captains depends on how many people sign up. Generally, priority will be given to past league participants and known community members, but we will try to be as fair as possible to everyone. Everyone that signs up is guaranteed a spot. If we don't have an even number of players per team, we will try to recruit more runners for the smaller teams and/or adjust the team score for balance.<br/><br/>
				<h3 id="points">HOW DO I EARN POINTS?</h3>
				Points are determined by Leaderboard position. The higher your rank is, the more points you get. The Basesystem is:
				<ul>
					<li>The last place gets 1 point.</li>
					<li>For each higher placement you get one extra point.</li>
					<li>If you are between place 6 and 10, your points increase by 2 instead of 1.</li>
					<li>If you are between place 1 and 5, your points increase by 3 instead of 2.</li>
					<li>Some categories give Bonuspoints onto the Basesystem due their lenght.</li>
					<li>Due The System being based off Leaderboard position, there is a maximum amount of points to catch per category.</li>
				<?php include 'pointsCalculator.php'; ?>
				<h3 id="src"> DO I NEED TO HAVE MY PBS ON SPEEDRUN.COM? </h3>
				To keep track of points PBs will have to be submitted by someone to speedrun.com. A mod can always submit for you if you prefer not to have a speedrun.com account.<br/><br/>
